These are some of the projects I worked on while doing a Full Stack developer course on Udemy. 

The course has helped me learn basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

I was introduced to the bootstrap framework which is quite useful in accellerating the web development process. 

When I started learning the basics of JavaScript, I coverred the syntax, data types and control structures. 

The frameworks and libraries I have used include jQuery, node.js , express and react.
